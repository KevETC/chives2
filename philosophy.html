										<h1>My Personal Music Philosophy</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>Music is an art form unlike any other art form. It is created though sound, vibration, and physics. It is much more than just sounds being put together. Music is created though rhythm, and timbres in combination with pitches that correspond well with one another to create harmonies and beautiful dissonances. We can also think of the elements of music, which are; sound, melody, harmony, rhythm, texture, form, and expression. Music requires a technician behind the instrument. The art of being able to play a musical instrument takes precision, discipline, commitment, and excellence. Music brings people happiness and brings people together. Unity is a wonderful element that should be implemented into our school systems, among other things.</p>
									<p>As a Music Pedagogy student, my aim is to provide students experience that I never had in my K through twelve education. Unfortunately, I did not have the privilege of studying music formally, until community college. After a few college courses, I came to the realization of the knowledge that I missed out on. I also realized how critical it is to have a solid foundation in music literacy, especially at an early age. This is why I believe it should be taught in primary, secondary, and high school settings. My personal goal to galvanize students with music, and to instruct in a manner that is well suited for young students to learn in a fun, active and engaged manner. Currently, I am developing myself as an educator, so that my future students can develop and mature musically at an early age. I plan on implementing adopted techniques, and tools to be able to improvise while teaching. Ideally, I will create my own style of instruction that will have a lasting impact on future musicians.</p>
									<p>Music has a multitude of benefits for young developing minds. Coming back to the idea of unity, educating students with a diversity of music, and music of different cultures will broaden their horizons. It allows them to be more accepting of cultures and appreciate the music of different people. There are other benefits to gain from music. These things include, building imagination, and intellectual curiosity. Students that study music early enough develop a craving for knowledge and have an enhanced imagination. This leads them to also develop their critical thinking that is useful in everyday life, especially as they develop into adulthood. When students learn music enough to be able to participate in an ensemble, they develop a greater understandingof teamwork which also better prepares them for their future careers. If students get to an elevated level of music making, they learn high level discipline. Music can also be an avenue to  social emotional learning. A great musician can also acquire a better sense of self, which is an excellent quality to have, especially for troubled youth in these modern times of self-awareness and social media.</p>
									<p>All and all, I would like to prepare students for life, by opening musical doors for them. I would like to give them the building blocks that they need to have a strong musical foundation. IfI can help them to enjoy, understand, create music, while gaining strong fundamental skills and knowledge, I would be pleased.</p>
